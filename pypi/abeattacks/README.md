This python module contain the attacks against ABE schemes presented
at Black Hat Europe 2021 by Antonio de la Piedra and Marloes Venema.

At the CT-RSA 2021 conference, Venema and Alp√°r presented attacks against 11 ABE and MA-ABE schemes, including the highly cited DAC-MACS scheme with applications to the cloud. 

We demonstrate the practicality of the attacks providing:
	- A decryption attack against DAC-MACS, where a single user is able to decrypt ciphertexts with policies she cannot satisfy. This user does not even need to collude with other users or corrupt an authority. 
	- A decryption attack with corruption of one of the authorities against the YJ14-MA-ABE scheme. 
	- A decryption attack against the YCT14 scheme where two users collude in order to obtain a decryption key based on the work of Tan et al. and Herranz (2019).
